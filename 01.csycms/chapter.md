CSYCMS is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based content management system, knowledge base and static site generator for nodejs. It uses static Markdown files to serve the content which are pulled from public/private repos in github, bitcket, gitlab or any other git repository management service. It runs services that enables it to auto update itself and the content it serves. It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, and allows you to use the structure of content files used in the [most popular flat file cms](https://getgrav.org) but in nodejs. In addition to this, it allows you to host several sites in one instance (installation) of it, and allows you to search across as many of your sites as you please. See more [features](csycms/Features).

Visit [csycms docs](http://learn.csycms.csymapp.com) to see a demo and get started!

The underlying architecture of CSYCMS is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [Hogan Templating](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/): for powerful control of the user interface
* Microservices to make deployments of multiple sites more stable

If you decide to go further with csycms, then please also learn how to pronouce it well. In declaring and defining the word, we intended that it should be pronouced as would `psy CMS` if that `psy` was  from words such as `psychology` etc.
