# Features

That csycms can compare with wordpress & co, we do not pretend. But it is flat file and they are not. And that csycms can compare with grav we do not pretend either. But it is nodejs and it is not. And with csycms you get extra features by which reasonable justification is found for its use and development.
## Common features
- Markdown for easy content creation

## Unique features
- Different themes for different files
- Several sites in a single installation (Like in shared hosting), making maintenance very easy.
- Search across multiple sites
- Auto-update of itself, the sites and the themes.
- Pulls sites content from github/gitlab/bitbucket, etc.
- Microservices (not in the scrictest sense of the word) to make deployments of multiple sites more stable

## Other advantages
- Very easy to learn.
